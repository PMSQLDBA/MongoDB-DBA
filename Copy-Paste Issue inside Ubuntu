a common VMware Workstation quirk — copy-paste between the host and your Ubuntu VM doesn’t work out-of-the-box unless VMware Tools (or the open-source equivalent) is properly installed in the guest.

Since you’re running Ubuntu 20.04.3 inside VMware Workstation, here’s how to get copy-paste working:

1. Install open-vm-tools & open-vm-tools-desktop

These packages handle clipboard sharing, drag-and-drop, and screen resizing.

sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop

2. Reboot the VM
sudo reboot

3. Enable Clipboard Sharing in VMware Workstation

On your host machine:

Shut down the VM (don’t just suspend).

In VMware Workstation, right-click your VM → Settings.

Go to Options tab → Guest Isolation.

Tick:
Enable copy and paste
Enable drag and drop
Click OK, then start the VM.

4. Test copy-paste

Try copying text from your host into a terminal in Ubuntu.
If it still doesn’t work in Terminal, test in Text Editor — sometimes terminal clipboard requires keyboard shortcuts:

Paste into terminal: Ctrl+Shift+V (not Ctrl+V)

Copy from terminal: Ctrl+Shift+C
